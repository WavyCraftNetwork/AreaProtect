# AreaProtect
With commands you can now manage area's! How it works is so basiclly run the command **/area create <tag>** to initiate the claiming proccess. Click on 2 points and it will automaticlly save the area within a json. You can now do **/area edit <tag>** to manage the area for example handle block placement ect.
